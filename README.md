##Introduction
In onder to meet the increasing demands of fragmented reading, we bulid a website to make it possible for people to do cooperative writing. Traditionaly, novels are usually published by one author, but now everyone can be the contributor of the story. We fork the story and write the branches of it, intergrating our originality and passion to build unlimited plots. Recommendation algorithm is applied to the site, which helps to present the highest quality content to readers.
